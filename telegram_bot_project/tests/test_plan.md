#  TEST PLAN — Telegram Client Bot

---

## INTRODUCTION

This document outlines the QA plan for testing the Telegram Client Bot — a Python-based Telegram chatbot that collects user information through a step-by-step questionnaire and answers frequently asked questions. The bot uses Flask to handle webhook requests and is deployed via PythonAnywhere.

Testing focuses on validating bot commands, message flows, input validation, webhook communication, and overall user experience.

---

## 1. OBJECTIVES

- Verify functional correctness of implemented bot features:
  - `/start` command (greeting)
  - `/faq` command (static response)
  - `/tour` command (multi-step form)
- Ensure correct integration with Telegram Bot API
- Validate input (e.g. email format)
- Confirm bot’s stability via webhook and error handling
- Identify any usability or logic issues

---

## 2. SCOPE

### In Scope:
- Functional and negative testing of bot commands
- API testing using Telegram Bot API
- Webhook setup and validation via Telegram
- Input validation and empty input handling
- Basic usability testing of chatbot flows

### Out of Scope:
- Load/performance testing
- Telegram app UI (not controlled by us)
- Voice input or AI integration
- Multi-language support

## 3. ASSUMPTIONS / RISKS

### 3.1 ASSUMPTIONS

- Telegram API is available and responsive
- PythonAnywhere server is operational and Flask app is running
- Webhook is properly configured and secured
- Internet connection is stable during test execution

### 3.2 RISKS

| Risk                                  | Mitigation                               |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Telegram API downtime                 | Retry later; document as blocked case     |
| Webhook misconfiguration              | Use `getWebhookInfo` to debug             |
| Logic bugs in multi-step flow         | Add detailed test cases and recheck state |
| Email validation too weak             | Use regex check and report edge cases     |
| Delay in message delivery             | Monitor timestamps and retry manually     |

---

## 4. TEST APPROACH

Testing will follow a **black-box, manual approach**, covering both functional and negative test scenarios.

### 4.1 TEST AUTOMATION

- API endpoints will be tested via **Postman** collections.
- No unit test or CI/CD automation pipeline is implemented (due to project scope).
- Future plan: basic Pytest coverage for webhook logic.
