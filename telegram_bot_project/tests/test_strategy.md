# Test Strategy: Telegram Client Bot

## 1. Objective

This document defines the testing strategy for the Telegram Bot — a Python-based chatbot deployed on PythonAnywhere via Flask and webhook integration.

Goals of testing:
- Functional correctness of bot commands and user flows;
- Stability of webhook and server communication;
- Valid API responses;
- Robustness and correct response across edge cases and invalid inputs.

---

## 2. Scope of Testing

### In Scope:
- Command handling (`/start`, `/tour`, `/faq`)
- Questionnaire logic (sequential interaction)
- API interaction via Telegram Bot API (e.g., sendMessage, getUpdates)
- Deployment environment (PythonAnywhere)
- Input validation (e.g., email format)
- Error handling and empty responses
- Webhook behavior and delays

---

## 3. Types of Testing

| Type                  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Functional Testing** | Verifying expected bot behavior per command |
| **API Testing**        | Testing Telegram Bot API endpoints via Postman |
| **Usability Testing**  | Clarity and friendliness of responses |
| **Negative Testing**   | Testing invalid, empty or malformed inputs |
| **Smoke Testing**      | Minimal command flow check post-deployment |
| **Regression Testing** | Re-running major flows after changes |

---

## 4. Testing Approach

- Manual black-box testing using Telegram interface
- Postman used for direct API requests to Telegram endpoints
- Logs monitored via PythonAnywhere console
- Test documentation created in Markdown format

---

## 5. Tools & Technologies

- `Python` / `Flask` / `python-telegram-bot`
- `Postman` for API testing
- `GitHub` for version control
- `PythonAnywhere` for deployment
- Markdown for documentation

---

## 6. Entry & Exit Criteria

**Entry:**
- Flask app is deployed and webhook is set
- Basic bot logic is implemented
- Postman collection is available

**Exit:**
- All test scenarios executed
- All critical test cases passed
- No high-severity bugs remain open
- Logs and responses are stable

## 7. Risk & Mitigation

| Risk                               | Mitigation                        |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Telegram API delay or failure      | Add retry logic and timeouts      |
| Webhook misconfiguration           | Use Telegram's `getWebhookInfo`   |
| Missed edge cases                  | Include exploratory testing phase |
| Deployment issues (PythonAnywhere) | Use logs and manual health checks |
